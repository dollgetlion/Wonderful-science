如图所示，小圆和大圆共用一个圆心，起点相同，都在起点p处。当大圆无滑动地滚动一圈到达下一个p点时,小圆也随着大圆滚动了一圈。这时，大圆和小圆都滚动了看似相同的距离（蓝线与黑线互相平行），可实际上大圆和小圆的周长是不一样的，请问这是为什么？

English translation：
As shown in the diagram, the small circle and the great circle share the same center of the circle, and the starting point is the same, both at the starting point p. When the great circle rolls one circle without slipping to the next point p, the small circle also rolls with the great circle. At this time, the great circle and the small circle both roll at the same distance (the blue line and the black line are parallel to each other), but in fact the circumference of the big circle and the small circle are different, why is this?
